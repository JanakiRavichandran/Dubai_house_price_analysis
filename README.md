🏠 Dubai Housing Price Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing the Dubai housing market. Using Tableau and Excel, the analysis explores patterns in pricing based on square footage, year built, and neighborhood type (urban, rural, suburb).
The goal is to uncover key trends, contradictions, and provide data-driven insights useful for buyers, sellers, and market analysts.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
📊 Tableau – Dashboard and interactive visualizations

📄 Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

🧠 Labmentix - Data Analytics Internship

📈 Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes:

KPIs: Summary of key metrics (average price, listings, etc.)

Median Price per Square Foot – Bar chart by house size & neighborhood

Median Price by Year Built – Line chart showing price trends over time

Square Feet vs Price – Scatter plot for overall price comparison

Price per Square Foot Distribution – Histogram of pricing range

% of Price by Year Built – Line chart (also broken down by neighborhood)

% Change in Price by Neighborhood – Bar chart across build years

📊 Key Insights
Small houses have the highest price per square foot across all neighborhoods.

Large houses have a higher total price, but offer better value per square foot.

Homes built in 1973 have a surprisingly high median price — higher than newer constructions.

The year 2013 (urban), 2010 (rural), and 1962 (suburb) show peak contribution to total market value.

1961, 2012, and 1983 show negative or low market contribution, suggesting older or less-desirable inventory.

While some years show high prices, they may have lower representation, which leads to percentage contradictions across graphs — explained through detailed analysis.
